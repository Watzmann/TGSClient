Setup Instructions for TGSClient
================================

When you want to run your own installation of this HTML5 client, you need to meet certain prerequisites and preparations.

Running your own installation requires a webserver somewhere. I expect you to know how to do that. The webserver must be able to publish your HTML5 client installation.

Prerequisites:

jquery.js > 2.0
sprintf.js

Installation:

1) Clone this repository.
2) Go to the repository.
...$ python administration/board_css.py > board.css
3) Move jquery.js and sprintf.js to a folder 'third_party'.
4) Create a folder 'resources/board' and fill it with gifs.
   You might use the gifs as supplied with JavaFibs (java client)
   in one of their 'boards' distributions.
