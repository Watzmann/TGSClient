#
# Nomenclature for HTML5 client (TGC) messages:
#
# Messages are categorized according to message window, the message is intended
# for. There are the following windows:
#   a) Player list window
#   b) Notification area (login/logout, ...)
#   c) shouts, ...
#   d) personal chats, ....
#   e) match/game/board
#   f) messages
#   g) who
#   h) system messages (leading '** ')
#   q) system messages (leading '** ') as 'h' cannot hold more than 99 messages
#   i) information messages
#   l) login/registration messages
#
# In addition the messages are uniquely numbered within each category.
#
# Messages with a single data variable are not in JSON format, as the client
# may simply parse that variable itself.


#   a) Player list window
