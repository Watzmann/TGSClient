## HTML5 Client for TigerGammonServer

TigerGammon is a free online Backgammon server. You play against humans or bots.

The simplest way to connect is using telnet:

    telnet ti-ga.com 4321

If you prefer a graphical user interface, you'll pick from a bunch of available rich clients which satisfy the TigerGammon API. Of course you are here to see the HTML5 client, but if you are interested look at this [list of rich clients](http://tigergammon.com/en/online-backgammon/?open=client/download), compatible to TigerGammon.

This repository contains the code for an HTML5 client. The setup for your own client is described in the wiki.
